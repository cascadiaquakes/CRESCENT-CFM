# CRESCENT-CFM

**CRESCENT-CFM** is a repository developed to support the Community Fault Model ([CFM](https://cascadiaquakes.org/cfm/)) of the [CRESCENT project](https://cascadiaquakes.org/). This repository is designed to provide data and tools for researchers, scientists, and geophysicists working with CFM data.

## Features

**Data Files** 

The data files are all vector GIS files. They are located in the 
`crescent_cfm_files` folder. Additional scripts and resources within the 
repository are provided to aid in building and working with the CFM.

There are a number of files here, representing the CFM:
- `crescent_cfm_crustal_traces` This is the GIS file of crustal fault traces. 
  It is available in GeoJSON, GeoPackage, and KML formats.
- `crescent_cfm_crustal_3d` This GIS file has 3D representations of the crustal 
  faults. The 3D surfaces are triangular meshes.
- `casie21_plate_boundary.geojson` This is the Cascadia plate boundary from 
  Carbotte et al., 2024, represented as a triangular mesh. In this version, 
  each triangle is a separate GIS feature.
- `casie21_plate_boundary_multipart.geojson` This is the Cascadia plate 
  boundary from Carbotte et al., 2024, represented as a triangular mesh. In 
  this version, the entire surface is represented as a single multipart GIS 
  feature, which is optimized for many purposes, but cannot store information 
  element-wise.
- `slab2_cascadia_interface.geojson` This is the Cascadia plate boundary from 
  Slab2 (Hayes et al., 2018), represented as a triangular mesh. In this 
  version, each triangle is a separate GIS feature.
- `slab2_cascadia_interface_multipart.geojson` This is the Cascadia plate 
  boundary from Slab2 (Hayes et al., 2018), represented as a triangular mesh. 
  In this version, the entire surface is represented as a single multipart GIS 
  feature, which is optimized for many purposes, but cannot store information 
  element-wise.
- `mcrory_2012_cascadia_interface.geojson` This is the Cascadia plate boundary 
  from McRory et al., 2012. This is created as a mesh from the contours 
  provided by McRory, so it is somewhat lower resolution than the slab 
  geometries created from the Casie21 and Slab2 projects. It is a multipart GIS 
  feature.
- `cascadia_subduction_interface_temp.geojson` This is a mesh from Graham et 
  al., 2018, created from data of uncertain provenance.

The onshore (crustal) faults are taken from two sources: The USGS National
Seismic Hazard Map (NSHM 23) project (Hatem et al., 2022), and in-progress
collaborative research by Natural Resources Canada and the GEM Foundation
(Hobbs et al., *in prep*; Styron et al.,, *in prep*).

**Fault Model Visualization**  
A 3D mapping web interface for visualizing fault surfaces and traces is accessible through the [CFM web interface](https://cfm.cascadiaquakes.org/).
